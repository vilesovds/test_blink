The test task itself is located in the TestRTOS.docx file

I used a BlackPill board, a solderless board and three LEDs. Some of the code is borrowed from the examples. Getting the string was completely assigned to the console subsys (see https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/console/getline/README.html)
