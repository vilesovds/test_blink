# test_blink
The test task itself is located in the [TestRTOS.docx](https://github.com/vilesovds/test_blink/blob/main/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B5RTOS.docx) file

I used a BlackPill board, a solderless board and three LEDs. Some of the code is borrowed from the examples. Getting the string was completely assigned to the console subsys (see https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/samples/subsys/console/getline/README.html)
